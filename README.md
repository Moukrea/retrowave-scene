# retrowave-scene
A Retrowave/Synthwave/Vaporwave inspired scene using Three.js

The scene does not include any of its dependencies.

In order to get this working, simply type ``npm install``
in your code editor terminal to load all dependencies included in package.json

As I didn't want to use Webpack nor Browserify for such a small project, I used relative paths for in all my imports (in RetrowaveScene.js). Update them if you want to move files !
